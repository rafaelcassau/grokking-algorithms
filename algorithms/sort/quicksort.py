"""
Quick sort is a sortable algorithm that use divide by conquer strategy by calling itself until each part of array become less than 2 elements

Best case O(N log N)
Average case O(N log N)
Worst case O(NÂ²)

Each time that quicksort is called recursively a O(N) operation is done.
O(log N) is the size of the stack with the amount of recursive calls

In this case the pivot position matters to reach a good performance.

Quicksort and Mergesort has the same asymtotic complexity, but when the complexity is equivalent, the constant C 'time' is important to consider the better performance, and in this context the constant C in Quicksort is more faster than the same constant in Mergesort.
